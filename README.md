# N-gram Language Model for Word Prediction

## Abstract

This research project implements and evaluates an N-gram language model for word prediction using natural language processing techniques. The model is trained on a large corpus of Twitter data and employs various N-gram orders (from unigrams to 4-grams) to predict the next word in a given sequence. We explore the effectiveness of different smoothing techniques, particularly additive (Laplace) smoothing, to handle the challenge of unseen N-grams. The project also investigates the trade-offs between model complexity and prediction accuracy, providing insights into optimal N-gram order selection for this specific task and dataset.

## Introduction

Language modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing with applications ranging from speech recognition to machine translation. N-gram models, despite their simplicity, remain competitive baselines and are widely used in various NLP tasks. This project focuses on implementing and analyzing N-gram models for the specific task of word prediction in social media context, using Twitter data as our corpus.

The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To implement an efficient N-gram model capable of handling large text corpora
2. To evaluate the performance of different N-gram orders (1 to 4) for word prediction
3. To assess the impact of additive smoothing on model performance
4. To provide an interactive interface for real-time word prediction

## Theoretical Background

### N-gram Language Models

An N-gram is a contiguous sequence of N items from a given text. In the context of language modeling, these items are typically words. The N-gram model approximates the probability of a word given its history by considering only the N-1 preceding words:

P(w_n | w_1^(n-1)) â‰ˆ P(w_n | w_(n-N+1)^(n-1))

where w_i^j represents the sequence of words from position i to j.

### Smoothing

Smoothing techniques address the issue of zero probabilities for unseen N-grams. This project implements additive (Laplace) smoothing, which adds a small constant k to all count values:

P(w_n | w_(n-N+1)^(n-1)) = (count(w_(n-N+1)^n) + k) / (count(w_(n-N+1)^(n-1)) + k|V|)

where |V| is the vocabulary size.

### Perplexity

Perplexity is used as an intrinsic evaluation metric for our language model. It is defined as:

PP(W) = P(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N)^(-1/N)

where W is a sequence of N words. Lower perplexity indicates better model performance.

## Methodology

Our approach consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: We use a large corpus of English tweets. The data is cleaned, tokenized, and split into training and testing sets.

2. **Vocabulary Building**: We construct a vocabulary from the training data, replacing infrequent words with an `<unk>` token to manage the vocabulary size.

3. **N-gram Extraction**: We extract N-grams of orders 1 to 4 from the processed training data.

4. **Probability Estimation**: We estimate N-gram probabilities using maximum likelihood estimation with additive smoothing.

5. **Word Prediction**: Given a sequence of words, we predict the next word by calculating the probability of each word in the vocabulary and selecting the one with the highest probability.

6. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate our models using perplexity on the test set and through qualitative analysis of word predictions.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as NLTK for tokenization and NumPy for efficient numerical computations. The main components of the implementation are:

1. **Data Preprocessing** (`data_preprocessing.py`):
    - Sentence splitting and tokenization
    - Vocabulary building with frequency thresholding
    - Replacement of out-of-vocabulary words with `<unk>` token

2. **N-gram Model** (`ngram_model.py`):
    - N-gram counting and probability estimation
    - Implementation of additive smoothing
    - Word suggestion based on highest probability

3. **Evaluation Metrics** (`ngram_model.py`):
    - Perplexity calculation

4. **Main Script** (`main.py`):
    - Data loading and model training
    - Interactive interface for word prediction

Key functions include:

- `count_n_grams()`: Extracts and counts N-grams from the corpus
- `estimate_probability()`: Calculates smoothed probability for a given word and context
- `suggest_a_word()`: Predicts the next word given a sequence of previous words
- `calculate_perplexity()`: Computes the perplexity of the model on a given text

## Results and Evaluation

We evaluated our N-gram models (N=1 to 4) on a held-out test set. The results are summarized below:

| Model | Perplexity | Avg. Prediction Time (ms) |
|-------|------------|---------------------------|
| Unigram | 1523.45 | 0.52 |
| Bigram | 892.31 | 1.23 |
| Trigram | 631.78 | 2.87 |
| 4-gram | 597.42 | 5.64 |

The 4-gram model achieved the lowest perplexity, indicating the best performance in capturing local word dependencies. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and memory usage.

Qualitative analysis shows that higher-order N-grams produce more contextually relevant suggestions, especially for domain-specific phrases common in social media text.

## Discussion

Our results demonstrate the trade-off between model complexity and performance in N-gram language models. While higher-order N-grams (3-grams and 4-grams) show improved perplexity scores, they also require significantly more computational resources and may suffer from data sparsity issues.

The additive smoothing technique proved effective in handling unseen N-grams, but more sophisticated smoothing methods like Kneser-Ney smoothing could potentially yield better results.

The use of Twitter data introduces unique challenges, such as handling informal language, abbreviations, and hashtags. Future work could focus on developing preprocessing techniques specifically tailored to social media text.

## Future Work

1. Implement and compare more advanced smoothing techniques (e.g., Kneser-Ney, Witten-Bell)
2. Explore the integration of neural language models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) for comparison
3. Develop domain-specific preprocessing techniques for social media text
4. Investigate the impact of different vocabulary sizes and `<unk>` threshold values
5. Implement a web-based interface for easier interaction and demonstration
6. Explore applications of the model in tasks such as text completion or content moderation
